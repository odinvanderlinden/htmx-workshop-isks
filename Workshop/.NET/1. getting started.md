# Introduction to HTMX

HTMX is a small (~14kb) extendable javascript library which gives you the possibility to make your website interactive without writing any javascript yourself. By leveraging custom attributes it gives access to AJAX, CSS transitions, Websockets and much more.

## This workshop

In today's fast-paced digital world, users expect not only visually appealing but also highly responsive and interactive web applications. While Server-Side Rendering (SSR) provides excellent performance and SEO benefits, it often lacks the dynamic interactivity that users crave. This is where HTMX comes into play, bridging the gap between traditional SSR and modern interactive web experiences.

During this workshop, we’ll take a hands-on approach to evolving a classic SSR application into a more interactive, seamless experience using the power of HTMX. You’ll learn how to enhance your web applications without the need for a heavy JavaScript framework, keeping your development lightweight and efficient while delivering a rich user experience.

By the end of this session, you'll have the knowledge and practical skills to:

1. Integrate HTMX into your SSR applications.
1. Create dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
1. Implement user interactions that feel smooth and natural, leveraging the strengths of both SSR and HTMX.
