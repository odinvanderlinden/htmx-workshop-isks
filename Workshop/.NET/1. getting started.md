# Introduction to HTMX

HTMX is a small (~14kb) extendable javascript library which gives you the possibility to make your website interactive without writing any javascript yourself. By leveraging custom attributes it gives access to AJAX, CSS transitions, Websockets and much more.

In today's fast-paced digital world, users expect not only visually appealing but also highly responsive and interactive web applications. While Server-Side Rendering (SSR) provides excellent performance and SEO benefits, it often lacks the dynamic interactivity that users crave. This is where HTMX comes into play, bridging the gap between traditional SSR and modern interactive web experiences.

## Why HTMX

HTMX provides a middle ground between traditional SSR applications and client-side JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. While SSR offers excellent performance and SEO benefits, it often lacks the dynamic user experience that modern web users expect. On the other hand, client-side frameworks can provide this interactivity but at the cost of increased complexity, larger bundle sizes, and potentially slower performance.

HTMX bridges this gap by allowing you to enhance your SSR applications with interactivity typically reserved for client-side apps, but without the overhead of a full-blown JavaScript framework. This approach offers several key benefits:

Reduced Complexity: Instead of managing state and interactions on the client side, you can leverage your existing server-side logic and HTMX’s simple attributes.
Improved Performance: By only sending and updating the necessary parts of your HTML, HTMX minimizes data transfer and speeds up page interactions.
SEO and Accessibility: Since HTMX enhances server-rendered HTML, your content remains crawlable by search engines, and you can maintain accessibility standards without additional effort.

## This workshop

During this workshop, we’ll take a hands-on approach to evolving a classic SSR application into a more interactive, seamless experience using the power of HTMX. You’ll learn how to enhance your web applications without the need for a heavy JavaScript framework, keeping your development lightweight and efficient while delivering a rich user experience.

By the end of this session, you'll have the knowledge and practical skills to:

1. Integrate HTMX into your SSR applications.
1. Create dynamic content updates without full page reloads.
1. Implement user interactions that feel smooth and natural, leveraging the strengths of both SSR and HTMX.
