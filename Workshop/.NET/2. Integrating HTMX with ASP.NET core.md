# Adding HTMX to ASP.NET core

Open the DotnetTodoApp with your favorite IDE/Editor.
First we must install HTMX. This can be done in two ways:

- By adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.2"></script>` to your layout file
- By downloading HTMX from [htmx.org](www.htmx.org), placing it in your javascript directory and referencing it within your layout file `<script src="~/js/htmx.min.js"></script>`

# Make our current functionality use HTMX

We'll start with the functionality to add a Todo Item.
HTMX gives us the possibility to retrieve HTML from the server and to put it in the DOM. To do this we'll have to a change our razor pages and our endpoints

## Changing our endpoints

This will be an easy change. Just make all the endpoints except the index in our todo controller return a partial view with the todo item in it. This will make it possible to let HTMX inject a small piece of HTML in our DOM

## Add Todo Item

To enable HTMX in our Razor page for adding a new todo item, we'll need to add or modify five HTMX attributes:

1. **Action Type (`hx-post`)**: First, specify the type of AJAX action we want to perform. Since we're adding a new item, we'll make a POST request using `hx-post="<your-url>"`.
2. **Trigger (`hx-trigger`)**: Next, define when the POST request should be triggered. We'll trigger the request upon form submission when the user presses Enter. Use `hx-trigger="submit"`. [Learn more about triggers here](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/).
3. **Response Handling (`hx-swap`)**: After firing the AJAX request, we need to determine how to handle the HTML response. We'll insert the new content before the end of our todo list using `hx-swap="beforeend"`. [Explore more swap options](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/).
4. **Targeting (`hx-target`)**: Ensure the HTML is rendered in the correct location by specifying the target element where the new content should be inserted. Use `hx-target="#todo-list"`. [Read more about target options](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-target/)
5. **Post-Request Action (`hx-on`)**: To enhance the user experience, we'll clear the input field after the item is submitted. This can be done with `hx-on::after-request="this.reset()""`.

## Toggle Todo Item

To convert our toggle functionality to use HTMX, we need to adjust the form element and add the following attributes:

1. **Element Replacement**: Replace the entire `<form>` element with a single `<input>` element. HTMX will handle the request, so a form is no longer necessary.
2. **Action Type (`hx-put`)**: Specify the URL to send a PUT request when the checkbox is clicked. Use `hx-put="@Url.Action("Toggle", "Todo", new { id = <item-id> })"` to target the correct action in your controller.
3. **Targeting (`hx-target`)**: Indicate which part of the DOM should be updated after the action is completed. In this case, target the specific list item by its ID with `hx-target="#list-item-<item-id>"`.
4. **Trigger (`hx-trigger`)**: Define the event that triggers the request. Here, a click event on the checkbox will initiate the request using `hx-trigger="click"`.
5. **Response Handling (`hx-swap`)**: Determine how the response from the server should be handled. Use `hx-swap="outerHTML"` to replace the entire checkbox element with the server's response, which may include a modified checkbox or any other updated content.

## Delete Todo Item

To transform our delete button into an HTMX-powered element, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Element Replacement**: Replace the `@Html.ActionLink` with an HTML `<button>` element. Buttons are better suited for HTMX interactions, enabling more dynamic HTTP requests directly from the button.
2. **Action Type (`hx-delete`)**: Specify the URL for sending a DELETE request. Use `hx-delete="@Url.Action("Delete", "Todo", new { id = <item-id> })"` to direct the request to the appropriate action.
3. **Targeting (`hx-target`)**: Target the specific DOM element that should be updated or removed upon completion. Use the item's ID with `hx-target="#list-item-<item-id>"` to ensure only the correct item is affected.
4. **Trigger (`hx-trigger`)**: Define the event that will trigger the HTMX request. For deleting an item, use a click event on the button with `hx-trigger="click"`.
5. **Response Handling (`hx-swap`)**: Determine how the response from the server should be handled. The `hx-swap="delete"` value will remove the target element from the DOM after a successful request.
