# Adding HTMX to ASP.NET core

Open the DotnetTodoApp with your favorite IDE/Editor.
First we must install HTMX. This can be done in two ways:

- By adding `<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.2"></script>` to your layout file
- By downloading HTMX from [htmx.org](www.htmx.org), placing it in your javascript directory and referencing it within your layout file `<script src="~/js/htmx.min.js"></script>`

# Make our current functionality use HTMX

We'll start with the functionality to add a Todo Item.

Change the view to use htmx
